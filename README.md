# Sun2 - Backend  (A clean restart of old sun codebase with focus for modular and service oriented )

This is backend for [android client](https://github.com/jozn/ms_native)

[First commit](https://github.com/jozn/sun2/commit/6c658d5c5be31e07c29056c9dc41222cb5938d86): a copy from old sun with changing significant architecture
Surpassed: https://github.com/jozn/sun

+80% is completed.
A note for small numbers of commits: I started fresh from old "sun" project, because my technology stack has evolved a lot and i started fresh and common copied the codes into this project and changed them as necessary.  
# Technologies Used
Service oriented. Small services with ability to bundle multi service at once into one executable file.
Websocket, Http, REST (not used anymore), Cassandra, MySQL, Custom RPC, protocol buffers , a lot of code generators. Experimental CockroachDB.

This app is event based. Every service stream events and listening to them and then process those event data. The event system is custom based on MySQL with batch processing in every few milliseconds to improve scalability. MySQL for this event system can be easily replaced with Kafka, but considering the performance of current implementation in MySQL is very high (10,000 - 100,000 events / sec on an average hardware) i choose to stick with MySQL for now and make it easier for deployment and less moving parts.  
# Features
+ Similar to what needed for Instagram backend: post, like, comments, notifications, hot posts, personal suggestions, logging.
+ Cassandra based file storage and file serving , with on fly converting and resizing of images then caching them on local disks, converting .gifs to .mp4 on fly and reducing a lot of its size. Highly scalable. Cached result in several discs.
+ Full Chat system with ability to push.

# Object Storage
+ source: https://github.com/jozn/sun2/tree/master/servises/file_service
+ Based on Cassandra. High scalability. Similar to what Walmart has done. This tool can stores any files, every files splits into smaller chunks before inserting to Cassandra. A group of custom http servers, sits between users and Cassandra and cache the output on their local disks. This http servers resize and convert images based on their http query parameters and extensions. This servers also convert .gif and .webp to .mp4 when requested, this significantly reduce animated .gif sizes. This server is planned to stream .mp4 with HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).
